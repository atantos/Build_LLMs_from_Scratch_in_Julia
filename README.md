# Building LLMs from Scratch in Julia

This repository is dedicated to translating the Python code from the book **[Building a Large Language Model (from Scratch)](https://a.co/d/8m6dP1m)** by [Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt) into Julia. The goal is to provide a Julia-based implementation of the concepts and techniques outlined in the book.

## 📚 About the Book

Sebastian Raschka's *Building a Large Language Model (from Scratch)* provides a hands-on approach to understanding the fundamental concepts behind large language models (LLMs), covering everything from tokenization to model training and inference. The book uses Python as the primary language, and this repository aims to make the same techniques accessible to Julia enthusiasts.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Julia Translation**: Translate the Python code examples from the book into idiomatic Julia, ensuring clarity and performance.
2. **Julia Ecosystem**: Showcase how Julia's libraries and tools can be used to implement LLM components, such as tokenization, embedding layers, and model architectures.
3. **Learning Resource**: Provide Julia users with a resource to learn about LLM development in their preferred language.
